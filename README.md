To run my code you need pygame. Best way to do this is create new virtual environment and install package from requirements.txt:
to create new wirtual enviroment type:

virtualenv -p python <your_virtualenv_name>

to activate wirtual enviroment type:

source <your_directory_with_wirtual_env>/bin/activate

to install packages from requirements.txt type:

pip install -r requirements.txt
