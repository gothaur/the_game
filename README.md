# Penguin of War

The game is very simple - you need to stay alive as long as you can. 
You must be cautious of your health and ammo, but don't worry, you can loot those from defeated enemies!
To move use keys up, down right and left;
To shoot use spacebar;
All your enemies will go only one direction - to your left. They can shoot and dodge your bullets!

One of your enemies dropped a gun, pick it up.

And there is a suprise. It can be ammo, health potion or a deadly mine. You'll never find out untill you'll pick it up.
