# the_game
result of my learning python with pygame library


To run my code you need pygame. Best way to do this is create new virtual environment and install package from requirements.txt:
to create new wirtual enviroment type:

virtualenv -p python <your_virtualenv_name>

to activate wirtual enviroment type:

source <your_directory_with_wirtual_env>/bin/activate

to install packages from requirements.txt type:

pip install -r requirements.txt
